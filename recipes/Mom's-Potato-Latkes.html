    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Latkes (a.k.a. potato pancakes) are a crowd-pleasing addition to any table
      — and this family recipe will impress even the pickiest eaters. The secret
      ingredient? Saltine crackers! The pantry staple replaces all-purpose
      flour, binds the latkes together, and contributes to the irresistible
      texture. Though they're traditionally served during Hanukkah, you'll want
      to enjoy these wonderfully crispy and savory latkes all year long.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>3 cups shredded potato</li>
      <li>¼ cup grated onion</li>
      <li>6 saltine crackers, or as needed, crushed</li>
      <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon salt, or more to taste</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>½ cup vegetable oil, or as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine potato, onion, crushed crackers, eggs, salt, and pepper together
        in a large bowl.
      </li>
      <li>Heat 1/4 inch oil in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
      <li>
        Drop spoonfuls of potato mixture, first pressing mixture against side of
        the bowl to remove excess liquid, into hot oil; slightly flatten latkes
        with the back of a spoon to make an even thickness.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook in batches until browned and crisp, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Drain
        latkes on a paper towel-lined plate.
      </li>
    </ol>
